# FerroCement-School
Open-Source project for building mini schools using e-waste laptops. 

It's very cool to inspire less fortunate folk and kids to have new interests and knowledge, so I sketched a complete system to build a mini education system for 10,000 rupees.

It re-uses an e-waste laptop LCD screen and control pads, a very tough glass inside wire-reinforced cement, so it's just a 15' LCD screen showing a wiki, library and other education materials running raspberry-pi, with an estimated lifetime between 2 and 12 years if there is no extreme vandalism of kids school property.

books, maths, navigation, alphabets, age levels can be just images selected by clicking, and people can choose what they learn about!!!

They just be able to help themselves and their community and environment! to further their prospects and safeguard their collective futures.

This is a list of components to build a mini school with a lifespan of 2-12:

SPOD book navigator specs: 

Bag Cement 25kg         .....  $3  ( Equator )
Scrap wire, metal, rocks.....  $5   wire to reinforce ferrocement
15.6 inch LCD           .....  $0   20W   e-waste we throw out 100 million laptops every year at least. 
LCD controller          .....  $20  15 inch LCD maximum
Vapor barrier           .....  $1   The electronics should be kept insulated from the cement, especially while it dries.
Silicone sealant        .....  $3   Electronics can be dipped in sealant for advanced humidity barrier
Touchpad -protection film....  $1   touchpade are free from e-waste and can be swapped any time
Tempered glass          .....  $0  ( waste car screen or real tempered glass is 10 dollars for a laptop screen size)
Raspberry Pi 2 zero W   .....  $25  1W  this handles SSD booting for high longevity compared to sd card 
used SSD 64gb           .....  $10  ... longevity 5+ yrs ( new ssd upgrade 30 )
Arduino Micro           .....  $5  to connect the touchpad to the rpi
Mini HDMI cable         .....  $3 
Micro USB cable 4 PiZero.....  $7
Speaker   + Amplifier   .....  $2    mini speakers can be found in laptops, phones and other sources. 
12V adapter 4Amps       .....  $5+    longevity related to price
5V adapter for Pi Zero  .....  $2                  




Total cost BOM               = < $120 using AC line, 1 LCD
                             = < $150 AC line, 2 LCD ( 2 hdmi )
                             = < $175 AC line, 3 LCD

Watts                        = 20W for 1 LCD. 
                             = 10 KWh / yr -  $1.00 / yr  

Upgrades:

30c^2    tempered glass ..... $22
solar kit               ..... $75

SPOD book navigator: 

Time to achieve 1 cent per hour of lessons: 3 years - at 12 hrs.day. 
Durability in good conditions: 5+ years, easy swap touchpads. fixable electronics. 
cost compared to US education. about 1000 times less. (13k annual)

SOFTWARE:

Custom OS digital library platform (i.e. calibre project), discovery layer GUI.
32/64/128 GB curated versions include: 
Donated books, learning apps, Audio lessons, Wikipedia chapters.
SD as bootloader only, and book files, Run OS from RAM, Alpine Linux maybe. 

Hardware notes: vapor barrier and absorbant matter for screen, silicone glued to glass. 
Sd card with wear-levelling. 

Education principles:

Maximize learning, minimize games. Game effects are only used to enhance learning on the learning pod.
Provide education to all ages, from 3 to 93. 
Prioritize local language, culture and sensibilities.
Context menu includes translation and dictionary for all words. 
Easy navigation GUI navbar always present includes search, languages, back, forward, home, etc. 
Instantly navigate to any page using a page number so students can pick up where they left off. 


Project priorities:

Encourage school expeditions, tourists, local engineers.
Pay exemplary projects: cash prizes and awards. 
Maximize durability for 10+ year lifespans.
Provide supplies, resources, DIY guides, literacy maps, local govt permits. 
Be sensitive to local vandalism rates, safe villages prioritized, crime areas experimental only.
Discuss with the village leader about: location, moveability, foundations, weight, shade, energy provision.
Involve the local elders to make decisions so they feel valued and that it is their project too. 
Provide hitch points to construct shades above and around pods. 


Add solar power = $80  ...  ( $30 30W Si + $10 Ctrl + $40 Bat )
Add HDMI splitter and 2nd LCD and Ctrl = $25, 
up to 4 screens / book navigator.

I like ecological and geographical education, so that people understand the planet's chemical and social, geography includes media freedom, multinationals, neo-colonialism, government corruption, how their planet was made, just the things that everyone should know!!!

Education is mostly universal, and people should have the choice of what they want to learn about: geology, medecine, types of germs, tropical parasitology, DIY databases from hackaday, river science, water science ...

Young children just need images and words and sounds and to interact with each other and with teachers, it's actually very beneficial to implement as much social athmosphere into a learning pod as possible.

There are so many digital educational materials with pictoral alphabets, maths and languages, DIY builder instrucation databases, kids wiki, adult wiki, that the most crucial thing is to supply the most essential ones for development.
